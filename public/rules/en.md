# ONO 99<sup>TM</sup> IN A NUTSHELL
You play cards from your hand onto the Discard Pile. Most cards have 
numbers on them, and as you add them to the pile the total number of 
the pile increases. A 3 placed onto a 7 puts the pile at 10. Add a 6 to 
the pile and now it’s 16 and so on. As the total number of the pile 
builds and builds, you must keep it UNDER 99. If you are unable to play 
a card without making the total hit 99 or above, you are out of the 
game.

# CONTENTS
112 Cards

# OBJECT
To be the last player left in the game.

# SETUP
- Shuffle the cards.
- Deal 4 cards to each player.
- Place the remaining cards **FACE DOWN** in the center of the table. 
This is the **DRAW PILE**.
- The player to the left of the Dealer starts by playing a card **FACE 
UP** next to the Draw Pile creating a Discard Pile, calling out the 
card or number value.

# ON YOUR TURN
- Play a card
- Add the value of your card to the previous total of the Discard Pile 
and announce the new total.
- Refill your hand to 4 cards.
- Each subsequent player does the same on their turn, always calling 
out the new total of the Discard Pile and drawing a card to end their 
turn.

> TIP
> 
> Always call out the Discard Pile total when you discard a card, even 
> if it doesn’t change the total.
>

If you are unable to play any card in your hand without causing the 
total to hit or exceed 99, you’re out – **DON’T PLAY ANY CARD!** Lay 
your cards down in front of you so the other players remember to skip 
you on following turns. 

Play then continues with the next player in order. 

# WINNING
The last player remaining in the game WINS!

# SPECIAL ACTION CARDS
## ONO 99<sup>TM</sup> CARD
***The bad news:*** if you are dealt or draw an ONO 99TM card, you must 
keep it and you may not play it.

***The good news:*** if you collect 4 ONO 99TM cards, you may discard
all of them at once (adding nothing to the pile total) and draw four
new cards.

## REVERSE CARD
The Reverse card changes the direction of play (clockwise to 
counterclockwise, and vice versa).

In a two-player game, it has the same effect as discarding a 0. 

## -10 CARD
The -10 card subtracts ten from the pile total. Negative totals 10 are 
not allowed.

## PLAY 2 CARD
Forces the next player in sequence to play two cards on their turn. Play
one card, call out the new total, draw a card, then play a second card.

You may also respond to a Play 2 card by playing a Reverse card and
forcing it back the other way OR play your own Play 2 card and pass it
along to the next player (who will only have to play two cards as Play 2’s
don’t “stack’). It's possible for a Play 2 to end up being passed around
and reversed multiple times before finally hitting one unlucky player!

If you are hit with a Play 2 and are able to play one card but then are
unable to successfully play the second card you are out of the game.

# NOTE:
- If NO ONE is able to play a card without causing the total to hit or 
exceed 99, the last player to successfully play a card on the Discard 
Pile is the winner.
- If the Draw Pile runs out before play ends, reshuffle the Discard 
Pile to form a new Draw Pile.
- If a player is eliminated by the Play 2 card, and cannot play, the 
following player in turn order is NOT required to play 2 cards.
